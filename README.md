### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jaswinder Singh Layal, a web developer & designer with over 2 years of experience in a wide range of disciplines. Currently learning native Mobile Application Development at Cambrain College of Arts and Technology.

I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development. My skills are broad from ux to design, front end to back end. I enjoy each aspect.
